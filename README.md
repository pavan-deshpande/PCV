The idea of the Project is to predict the possibility of existence of any path between two 
devices using mobility models and then predicting the contact volume of that path to use it 
to reliably transfer the data between those devices. This would avoid any wastage of bandwidth 
and battery consumption caused due to unsuccessful transfer of data. A situation where two d
evices within the communication range are viewing the same video can make use of this. 
Instead of downloading the video on both devices it is downloaded partially on both devices after 
predicting the contact volume. The partially downloaded video can be shared between each other to 
enjoy high quality video. To predict the contact volume of a path we need to predict the contact 
volume between each pair of devices in the path that are connected and find the bottleneck path. 
This volume is the contact volume for the path. The Project is based on the application of the 
idea proposed in the paper “PCV” Qayyum Shiraz et al.
